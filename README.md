# Project: LIBFT - Building a Comprehensive C Library

## Project Overview

The primary objective of LIBFT was to develop a personal C library containing a wide array of functions, ranging from basic string manipulations to more complex memory management operations. This project not only reinforced my understanding of C programming concepts but also honed my skills in creating efficient, well-documented, and reusable code.

## Key Components

### Libc Functions

I reimplemented various standard C library functions, including but not limited to:

- **String manipulation:** `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strdup`, `strlcpy`
- **Memory operations:** `memset`, `memcpy`, `memmove`
- **Character checks:** `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `isalnum`
- **String-to-number conversions:** `atoi`

### Additional Functions

Beyond the standard library functions, I developed several additional utilities:

- **String operations:** `substr`, `strjoin`, `strtrim`
- **Memory allocation wrappers:** `calloc`
- **File descriptor operations**

### Bonus Functions

- Creating and deleting nodes
- Adding nodes to the front or back of a list
- Applying functions to list elements
- Sorting and filtering list contents

## Technical Challenges

- Ensuring memory safety and preventing leaks
- Optimizing functions for performance
- Handling edge cases and potential errors
- Maintaining consistent coding style and documentation

## Key Learnings

- Low-level memory management in C
- The importance of code optimization and efficiency
- Best practices in function design and implementation
- The intricacies of the C standard library

## Future Applications

LIBFT serves as a cornerstone for future projects at 42 and beyond. Having a personally crafted, well-understood set of functions will streamline development in upcoming assignments and personal projects, allowing for more focus on complex problem-solving rather than reimplementing basic functionalities.
